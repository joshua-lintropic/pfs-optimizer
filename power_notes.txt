notes on the power_law() data test. 

IDEA: sanity check - we can establish a crude upper bound on sharp utility
note there are 1000 exposures total (10 exposures * 100 fibers/exposure)
median umax seems around 10
median Ttarget seems around 2

so at most we should be able to get 500 targets (1000 / 2) to completion
with per-target umax 10, this gives around 5000 utility

which is what the optimizer does. 

IDEA: skew the distribution - we can make the higher utility targets better, 
    and the lower utility targets worse. Then measure the average umax which
    is attained. It should be higher. 
note, may have to adjust number of fibers so that optimizer cannot just go
for everything.
